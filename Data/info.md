# Data set info

This folder contains a data set with 16500 random values generated by the machine.
These measurements was made in more than 12 hours of operation of the machine.
You can use them as random values in your owns projects or analyze them to check that the machine is not biased.
The files are in CSV format.

The raw.csv file contains the aggregated values of all sensors each time a marble passes in front of the sensor.     
**be careful with this raw value the distribution is not homogeneous because there are more balls that finish in 2.5s than in 10s for example.*

The hex.csv and bin.csv files give the same values in Hexadecimal and in binary. 
**These are the pseudo-random data generated by the machine.**
They are obtained by respectively performing a modulo 16 and 2 on the raw data.
