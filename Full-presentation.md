# Full presentation of The KZG Marble Machine by Xofee

## Summary 

This presentation aims to supplement the information found in the [Readme file](/README.md).

If you want more information about the KZG Ceremony, you can find it on the dedicated [GitHub Pages](https://github.com/ethereum/kzg-ceremony).

## Obstacles 

We will deconstruct each obstacle of the KZG Marble Machine to understand its functioning.

The best place to start is with the title: ETHEREUM. We'll take a look at some of its major milestones.

In 2014, Vitalik published the Ethereum White Paper 📝, which marked the beginning of the project. This obstacle is powered by the logo rotating randomly 🔄, deflecting the marbles.

In 2015, 🏁 the first blocks of Ethereum were mine and worked smoothly until...

In 2016, there was a setback with the hack of The DAO and the Shanghai attack. Here we see a funnel that sucks all the marbles 🌪️.

In 2017, the NFT craze is depicted with a CryptoKitty (#634995) congesting the marble flow with its paws. 🐾

We delve into the complexities of decentralized finance with the 2020 DEFI Summer.

We find the 🔥 Burn mechanism of the EIP1559 with a switch that diverts some of the marbles. This update was implemented during the London fork in August 2021.

Next, we come to the moment of the merge symbolized by a panda 🐼. Upstream, we have the miners' pickaxes ⛏️ representing the Proof of Work era.

In September 2022, we move to proof of stake with the marbles flowing between the ETH staked 🪙.

We then reach the layer 2, which operates in parallel ⛓️ with Ethereum to improve scalability.

We arrive at a blob that absorbs data to make more room for the layer 2s. The KZG ceremony 🕯️ with the EIP 4844 will enable the deployment of this new data type.

The end of the course features a sensor measuring the final interval between two marbles to generate entropy 🎲. Then we discover a vision of a future built on Ethereum 🏙️.

Finally, we come to a rocket 🚀 (familiar to some in the community) which uses an elevator to raise the marbles to the top of the course. ⏫
